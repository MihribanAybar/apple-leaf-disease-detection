# Apple Leaf Disease Detection

This project aims to detect diseases in apple leaves using convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The models used include Xception and InceptionV3. The project leverages the PlantVillage dataset and involves model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Structure

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `plantvillage-dataset/`: Directory for storing dataset images.
- `inception_model.h5`: Trained model file for InceptionV3.
- `xception_model.h5`: Trained model file for Xception.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages for the project.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
